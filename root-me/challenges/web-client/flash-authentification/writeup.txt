we have to use an old version of a browser to make the flash work , or using ruffer 
its used on interactive animation but it not used now 

then ive found a tcheck on the code
if  value = md5 and decoding it gived me this
  41.....AA
so am searching about it 
the password is about 6 digit
and so i made this table using dcode


and ive found some hints to find the real digits 
and also the swf helps but my method was with pen and paper :)
