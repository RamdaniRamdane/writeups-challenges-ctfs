this site uses relative paths such as /static/main.js
and when i use ../ in the link its goes back to main one 
and its getting all the resorses from upload/static/filename
and all the uploads are on the /static/uploads/hash/filename

i cheked the dom and i found that on load its gets a main.js 
lets copy it and add an alert and see what happens
